                         Comprehensive Performance Report
================================================================================

Executive Summary:
Partitioning improves query performance, particularly for recent data, and significantly reduces maintenance costs.

Query Performance Analysis:
---------------------------
Query: Daily Active Users
   Monolithic Time: 0.5920s
   Partitioned Time: 0.3346s
   Performance Improvement: 43.47%

Query: Most Engaged Users Last 7 Days
   Monolithic Time: 0.4586s
   Partitioned Time: 0.3019s
   Performance Improvement: 34.17%

Storage Impact:
---------------
   Monolithic Table Size: 352 MB
   Partitioned Total Size: 806 MB
   Note: Partitioning does not significantly reduce storage; it organizes data and indexes more efficiently for targeted queries and maintenance.

Maintenance Benefits:
---------------------
   - Insertion Performance:
        Monolithic Time: 0.3615s
        Partitioned Time: 0.3701s
        Performance Improvement: -2.39%
   - Vacuum Analyze Speed: Partitioning allows for faster maintenance, such as vacuuming and analyzing individual partitions.
   - Data Archival: Dropping partitions for archival is an O(1) operation, which is far more efficient than deleting data from a monolithic table.
   - Reindexing: Reindexing a partitioned table is less disruptive and can be done on individual partitions.

Recommendations for Production Deployment:
------------------------------------------
   - Use partitioned tables for new data.
   - Automate partition creation via cron jobs.
   - Implement a data archival policy for partitions older than 1-2 years.
